# Hacking on Frappix

Frappix' `./local` cell contrains the full specification of the local contribution environment.

If you don't have Nix installed, you can start contributing by simply run the following command:

```console
bash <(curl -L https://blaggacao.github.io/frappix/install)
```

This will install, if not already:

- Nix: _orchestrate the environment_
- Direnv: _enable the environment when entering the folder_
- Frx: _the frappix tool, can be also used on your Frappix projects_
